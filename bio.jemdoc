Mikel Hernaez is the current Director for Computational Genomics at the [https://www.igb.illinois.edu/ Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology] at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). From 2013-2016 we was a postdoctoral Scholar at Electrical Engineering Department at Stanford University in the group of [https://web.stanford.edu/~tsachy/index.html Prof. Tsachy Weissman]. Prior to Stanford, he was the Director of Research at [https://enigmedia.es/ Enigmedia], a start-up developing crypto solutions based in Spain. In 2012 he graduated from his PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Navarra under the supervision of Prof. Pedro Crespo.

During his time at Stanford, he was the organizer of the [https://compression.stanford.edu/ Stanford Compression Forum], and an active member of the [https://sdsi.stanford.edu/ Stanford Data Science Initiative]. He was also among the few selected individuals that participated in the Pear Garage, an entrepreneurial mentoring program from [https://www.pear.vc Pear VC] in Palo Alto, CA.

Currently, he is one of the leaders of the upcoming International Standard for Genomic Information Representation, [https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-g MPEG-G], which will change how genomic data is stored, processed and analyzed.

His research interests are Data Compression, Computational Biology, Machine Learning and Information Theory and Coding. 

His Postdoc was partially funded by the [https://sdsi.stanford.edu/ Stanford Data Science Initiative], and during his masters he was awarded the Telefonica Scholarship.
